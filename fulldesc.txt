This is a simple web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)

It’s built using only front-end technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and runs entirely in the browser without any backend.

**Technologies Used**

* **HTML** – Provides the structure of the calculator (buttons, display screen).
* **CSS** – Styles the layout, buttons, and overall look of the calculator.
* **JavaScript** – Adds functionality: responds to button clicks, processes expressions, and updates the display.

**Key Features**

* Interactive number and operator buttons
* `=` button to calculate and display result
* `C` (clear) button to reset the input
* Basic input validation using `try-catch` to handle errors like division by zero or invalid expressions

**User Interface**

* A display box shows the current input or result
* A grid of buttons for digits (0–9), operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), decimal (`.`), equals (`=`), and clear (`C`)
* Responsive and user-friendly layout styled with CSS

**How It Works**

1. When a user clicks a number or operator button, JavaScript appends it to the display.
2. Clicking `=` triggers the `eval()` function to calculate the result.
3. If the expression is valid, the result is shown. If not, it shows `"Error"`.
4. Clicking `C` clears the display.

 **Ideal For**

* Beginners learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Understanding DOM manipulation and event handling
* Creating and deploying a basic functional web app
